# Only craft once
Do you only want one mace on the server? Are you annoyed by the idea of unlimited items? Then this mod is for you!

You can set the maximum amount of times an item can be crafted. After it's been crafted that many times, any recipes that make that item won't work.

<sub>Note: There is technically a difference between crafting and recipes. An example is iron nuggets. If you set a max times iron nuggets can be crafted, smelting equipment into nuggets wouldn't add to the times crafted, but once iron nuggets have been crafted that many times, smelting recipes for iron nuggets won't work.</sub>
